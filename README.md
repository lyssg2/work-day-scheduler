# work-day-scheduler

The purpose of this project was to make a website where the user can make a daily work schedule. The website is responsive and displays today's date, as well as indicates the past, current and present hour by color.

## Description

To make a schedule, the user will type in the description box their hourly task. Once the save button is clicked, it will then save the task in the local storage so that when the page is refreshed, their tasks will still display for reference. Each block represents the amount of hours for a typical work day. If the block is the darker blue color, it represents a past hour, if the block is purple, it is the current hour, and if it is light blue, it is a future hour.

## Getting Started

Required program(s) needed is any common internet browser with Javascript enabled in said browser (most browsers already have them installed and enabled).
